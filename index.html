    <h2>Getting it Through Your Head: How Biomedical Engineers are Using Nanoparticles and Focused Ultrasound to Treat
      Brain Tumors</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <span class="tooltip">word(for reference)<span class="tooltiptext">This is the definition of
        the
        word.</span></span>

    <p>
      You probably have not heard of biomedical engineers, but you use their inventions every single day. From the
      tomato
      in your sandwich to your leggings or the annual flu shot, biomedical engineering is everywhere! The role of a
      <span class="tooltip">biomedical engineer<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span> is to apply scientific
      discoveries and technology towards solving problems in health.
      <br><br>
      A major issue in health is <span class="tooltip">cancer<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>. Living
      creatures are made up of small subunits, called <span class="tooltip">cells<span
          class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>. Cancer is a disease where a person’s cells mutate and start
      dividing and growing uncontrollably. This can result in large growths of mutated cells, called a <span
        class="tooltip">tumor<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>. It is very likely you know of someone
      who has had cancer – it is estimated that around 2 in 5 Canadians will be diagnosed with cancer during their
      lifetime. Cancer is also the leading cause of death in the world.
      <br><br>
      A particularly difficult type of cancer to treat is tumors in the brain. Brain tumors are difficult to treat
      because: 1) it is difficult to detect brain tumors early on, 2) it is difficult to remove the tumors through
      surgery without damaging the brain, and 3) current cancer drugs cannot access the brain tumors due to the <span
        class="tooltip">blood-brain barrier<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>. The blood-brain barrier
      is a layer of very tightly spaced cells, which blocks the transport of certain molecules between the blood and the
      brain.
      <br><br>
      Biomedical engineers have been focusing on
      solving these two problems, researching and developing ways to 1) specifically target cancer cells without harming
      the brain and 2) allow cancer drugs to access tumors by bypassing the blood-brain barrier. A new approach that
      might solve these problems is a combination of two technologies: <span class="tooltip">focused ultrasound and
        nanoparticles<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>.
    </p>
    <h3>Focused What Now?</h3>
    <p>
      When you hear the word “ultrasound”, you might think of one of those cone-shaped black and white grainy pictures
      of you or a loved one as a baby, still growing inside the womb. This is an example of <span
        class="tooltip">ultrasound imaging<span class="tooltiptext">One way of looking inside the body using
          sound</span></span>.
    </p>

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      On the other hand, <span class="tooltip">focused ultrasound<span class="tooltiptext">Ultrasound but stronger and
          concentrated, which can vibrate, heat up, and even destroy tissue</span></span> (commonly abbreviated as FUS)
      is a newer technology that can vibrate, heat up, and even destroy tissue in a targeted area. Have you ever held a
      magnifying glass outside on a sunny day? If you have, you’d notice the sun converges to one single point in the
      middle - it’s focused. The sun by itself may feel warm on your skin, but that focused point can actually set
      things on fire! This is roughly analogous to how focused ultrasound works, but this time, we are using very high
      frequency sound instead of light. These
      focused sound waves can pass through skin without harm, but come to a focused point inside the body. One common
      application is to use <span class="tooltip">focused ultrasound<span class="tooltiptext">Ultrasound but stronger
          and concentrated, which can vibrate, heat up, and even destroy tissue</span></span> to damage a tumor in a
      controlled manner - this is typically referred to as <span class="tooltip">ablation<span
          class="tooltiptext">Controlled destruction of a tumor in the body</span></span>.

      FUS combines the metaphorical “sun” and “magnifying glass” into a single piece of technology designed by
      biomedical engineers, medical researchers, biologists, and physicists. This piece of technology is known as a
      <span class="tooltip">FUS transducer<span class="tooltiptext">A device that produces focused
          ultrasound</span></span> (shown above). In particular, this type of FUS transducer is known as a <span
        class="tooltip">concave focusing transducer<span class="tooltiptext">A FUS transducer which relies on geometry
          to focus the ultrasound</span></span>, which is called “concave” by the shape of the face of the device. There
      is ongoing research for lenses that focus sound (acoustic lenses) to make the device cheaper, which would make the
      device work more like how the magnifying glass focuses the sun. However, this isn’t the typical setup in FUS.
      <br><br>
      However, there is one downside to the standard concave focusing transducer. It is
      <span class="tooltip">fixed-focus<span class="tooltiptext">Referring to a transducer which will always focus
          ultrasound in the same place relative to the device</span></span>, which means the focused part of the
      ultrasound is always at the same place relative to the device, and the size of the focused part is always the
      same. While typically more expensive, the <span class="tooltip">phased array transducer<span class="tooltiptext">A
          transducer which uses clever timing to adjust the focus and position of the delivered focused
          ultrasound</span></span> design allows the focus to be changed. This allows for better precision during
      treatment, as we don’t want to damage healthy cells! The focus can also be moved without moving the actual device,
      in contrast with the concave focusing transducer which needs to be physically moved to ablate a
      different part of the tumor. The phased array transducer incorporates clever timing with many ultrasound elements
      (even thousands at a time!)
      to create <span class="tooltip">constructive interference<span class="tooltiptext">When two waves overlap they can
          form a stronger wave which is the addition of the two</span></span> of ultrasound at the specified focal
      point. One way to think of it is like this: The ultrasound wave has a certain speed, and a single element has a
      certain position. If we want the waves of two emitters to arrive at the same time, then since they are not at the
      same position, one must fire before the other, and the time can be calculated based on distance.

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      An example of a phased array transducer in
      development comes out of Sunnybrook Research Institute in Toronto, led by Dr. Kullervo Hynynen. This device is
      essentially a helmet that can deliver FUS to any part of the brain, which will be super useful for new brain
      disease treatments!
      <br><br>
      Surprisingly, FUS can do much more than ablate tissue when used at different power levels. At lower power, it can
      non-destructively vibrate cells in a way. That’s why it’s also being investigated for drug delivery. Our brain is
      an amazing organ, and it has a defense mechanism to filter out harmful substances in the blood that go to our
      brain. This defense mechanism is called the <span class="tooltip">blood brain barrier<span
          class="tooltiptext">Special cells which form a tight barrier to filter blood going into the
          brain</span></span> (BBB). However, if someone has a brain disease like a tumor, this can prevent a
      potentially life saving drug from getting to the tumor. Where does FUS come in? Dr. Hynynen’s group discovered
      that with FUS, in combination with <span class="tooltip">microbubbles<span class="tooltiptext">Very small bubbles
          which can vibrate and oscillate when exposed to focused ultrasound</span></span> (very small bubbles invisible
      to the naked eye) injected into the bloodstream, the BBB can be temporarily opened. The microbubbles vibrate
      rapidly, opening up gaps in between the cells that make up
      the BBB. This literally opens doors for drug delivery to the brain! But which drugs would we use, and why?

    </p>
    <h3>Small But Mighty</h3>
    <p>
      Typically, when someone has cancer, they will undergo chemotherapy. However, many chemotherapy drugs are not
      specific - they end up hurting the good cells too, which is why you see many lose hair during treatment. This lack
      of <span class="tooltip">specificity<span class="tooltiptext">The ability of a drug to target the desired area and
          not damage unwanted areas</span></span> can have substantial negative effects on the health of unaffected
      tissue and cells in the brain’s vasculature and microenvironment components [cite].
      <br><br>
      Have you heard of <span class="tooltip">nanoparticles<span class="tooltiptext">Very small carriers of drugs which
          can be engineered to have a specific target or survive in certain conditions</span></span>? They are
      essentially extremely small carriers of drugs. Nanoparticles can be one solution to specificity. They can be used
      as
      <span class="tooltip">controlled drug delivery systems<span class="tooltiptext">A method of getting a drug to go
          exactly where we want it to go, typically at a specified concentration and time</span></span> (DDS). Through
      careful design of the nanoparticles, they can
      target specific cells, like tumors.
      <br><br>
      Let’s walk through an analogy to make this a bit more digestible. Our non-specific chemotherapy drug is like
      blanket mailing - those random flyers you get in your mailbox. Some of the time, they may be useful to someone,
      but most of the time, they’re delivered to people who don’t even need them, just clogging up the mailbox! On the
      other hand, nanoparticles are like a very efficient
      delivery system - for example Amazon. You order something through an app because you need it, and it arrives right
      to you the very next day. Nanoparticles can be
      designed such that they can navigate the body and only target the tumor.
    </p>
    <h3>A Happy Marriage</h3>
    <p>
      Remember our friend, the great protector of the brain, the blood-brain barrier? The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) is
      designed to protect the brain from harmful substances such as toxins, pathogens among other things from entering
      brain tissue with ease. However, when a brain tumor develops, this vasculature can adopt new characteristics that
      are referred to as the <span class="tooltip">Brain Tumor Barrier<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>
      (BTB). Often BTB’s can be “leakier” than the unaffected BBB. In other
      cases of brain cancer, the BBB remains intact and limits the transport of chemotherapy drugs from accessing the
      tumor sites [cite nature.com source].
      <br><br>
      The blood-brain barrier will generally block nanoparticles from reaching the brain. Biomedical engineers and
      researchers have thought of a great idea, and this is where FUS comes in, which can selectively open the
      blood-brain barrier and allow our nanoparticles to traverse their way into the depths of the brain and target the
      tumor. A phased array device like K. Hynynen’s helmet could facilitate accurate targeting of FUS. This can improve
      the efficacy of chemotherapy treatment of brain tumors as well as minimize the negative effects of using these
      harsh agents for healthy tissue. This overall approach is much less invasive and safer than an open brain surgery,
      which could contribute to better outcomes in brain cancer patients.
    </p>
    <h3>Role of Biomedical Engineers</h3>
    <p>
      Biomedical engineers are responsible for not only designing the technical solutions for complex healthcare issues,
      but also doing their due diligence to investigate the impacts of their solution on social, economic, and
      environmental scales. Rigorously testing their designs against the requirements of stakeholders and evaluating the
      solution’s compliance with legal guidelines and regulations, biomedical engineers have a responsibility to ensure
      the safety and practicality of their solutions for the good of the public.
    </p>
    <h3>Sustainability</h3>
    <p>
      So far, we went into great detail explaining how combining FUS and lipid nanoparticles to treat brain tumors works
      and how it affects our society. But there’s an important question we have to ask before actually implementing this
      technology into the real world: “Can this technology be applied sustainably?” Before we answer this question,
      let’s define what sustainability means first. The United Nations defines sustainability as “meeting the needs of
      the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (cite). The term
      ‘needs’ here can refer to all sorts of needs, like physical needs to stay healthy, financial needs to buy things,
      and ecological needs to preserve the environment. In other words, we need to make sure that by treating brain
      tumors with FUS and lipid nanoparticles, we aren’t negatively affecting future generations in a societal,
      economic, and ecological way.

          Pillars of Sustainability</a>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Societal Sustainability</h3>
    <p>
      Let’s first revisit the societal impact of brain tumors - having a tumor grow inside someone’s brain means their
      everyday lives will be made much more difficult because they might forget things and their personality could
      change (cite). This will not only impact the patients but also their family and friends in their social circle;
      imagine your loved ones forgetting who you are and how devastating that could be. By implementing this new
      technology, we can expect the quality of life for both patients and their close connections to improve (cite). But
      does that mean this technology is available for everyone in society? Most likely not. Here’s why that is and what
      we can do to fix it.

      Lipid nanoparticles play such an important role in this treatment, but let’s remember that they may not work for
      everyone. The sad news is that your loved ones and other patients may be screened out by doctors for health
      reasons. Remember that lipid nanoparticles do not naturally form in a person’s body, so their <span
        class="tooltip">immune system<span class="tooltiptext">the natural defense system of the body that protects
          against harmful germs and any other agents that can cause sickness</span></span> might think it's harmful like
      an outside germ and decide to fight back. As a result, doctors and officials may decide that only certain people
      can be considered for this treatment while the people who do not meet the requirements are left out. For example,
      COVID-19 vaccines use lipid nanoparticles to make sure the medicine spreads throughout your body but some people
      cannot safely get it because of their age, medical history, and even allergies (cite). Similar to how different
      types of COVID-19 vaccines were recommended for different age groups, this new treatment needs to explore
      different ways to make different types of lipid nanoparticles (cite). Lipid nanoparticles can be made in a lab
      with a protocol much like making a favorite dish with a recipe. Therefore, it is important to continuously
      experiment with the recipe to make lipid nanoparticles even as this treatment is being used in order to make sure
      that different types of lipid nanoparticles are going to be discovered for people that may not be able to safely
      get this treatment right now. Doing this will make sure that this type of brain surgery is sustainable in the long
      run because more people will be able to benefit from it!
    </p>
    <h3>Economic Sustainability</h3>
    <p>
      People often think more effective disease treatment can only benefit the patients – they’re the ones getting
      healthier, right? But introducing FUS and nanoparticles to treat brain tumors can help the economy grow too!
      Here’s why.
      <br><br>
      Every time a patient gets checked by their doctor, it costs money and someone has to pay for it – either the
      government with taxpayer money or the patients themselves (cite). But more effective treatments let patients stay
      healthier for longer and need fewer follow-up visits to the doctor’s office (cite). That means by decreasing the
      total number of check-ups needed, FUS and nanoparticles can decrease the total cost to treat brain tumors (cite).
      Imagine this lower cost offered to every brain tumor patient – its economic impact will grow even greater!
      <br><br>
      But wait, what happens when not everyone gets equal access to this technology? After all, we come from different
      economic backgrounds and live in a world full of price tags. Studies show that wealthier people are far more
      likely to receive better healthcare treatments than poor people (cite). On top of that, brain surgeries are
      already very expensive as is (without FUS and nanoparticles involved), with patients paying approximately 75,000
      CAD in Canada (cite). That’s almost as much as the median income for Canadian households (cite)! If we were to
      implement this new technology without any financial support and ask the patients to pay for everything out of
      their pocket, most might not even be able to afford it. To prevent this technology from being an exclusive
      treatment option for the wealthy, it should be implemented in a way where the healthcare system actively looks for
      and reaches out to patients who need the technology (cite). This way, the healthcare system can act as a ‘safety
      net’ to protect brain tumor patients who need this treatment to survive but are unable to afford it on their own
      (cite).

    <h3>Ecological Sustainability</h3>
    <p>
      You might be wondering why a technology to treat brain tumors can have anything to do with the environment. How
      could brain tumor surgeries happening inside hospital doors affect trees growing in a provincial park? Here’s how.
      <br><br>
      Hospitals order lots of medical supplies – like surgical tools, equipment, and drugs – to provide patients with
      the treatments they need (cite). Since most of these supplies are produced from all around the world, they often
      need to be transported by airplanes (cite). And as we all know, transportation is one of the industries that
      produce the most carbon dioxide (or CO2), contributing to climate change (cite). On top of that, nanoparticles
      needed for this technology usually need to be kept at very low temperatures (around -80 °C) to work best, during
      both shipping and storage (cite). Let’s assume a company from the USA just made a fresh batch of nanoparticles,
      packed them in dry ice for cold storage, and shipped them off to a hospital in Europe via an airplane. How much
      CO2 do you think will be released to the environment?
      <br><br>
      More than 87,000 kg of CO2 - that’s a lot (cite)!

      Moving lipid nanoparticles that need to be frozen at around -80 °C is very bad for the environment right now.
      However, it is also a perfect example of a problem that needs to be fixed for the future. Fortunately, smart
      scientists are already working on different ways to store lipid nanoparticles or extend their shelf life which
      will be great for our planet! Having lipid nanoparticles with longer shelf lives means that more of them can be
      shipped in a single delivery and healthcare professionals won’t need to restock as often. Less deliveries means
      less planes and other CO2 emitting vehicles are being used! Already there is some research that is saying some
      labs are able to make lipid nanoparticles that can last 18 weeks in 25 °C in <span class="tooltip">phosphate
        buffered saline<span class="tooltiptext">a liquid used in labs, particularly useful in biological
          experiments</span></span> (PBS) without <span class="tooltip">cryoprotectants<span class="tooltiptext">a
          helpful chemical used to protect organics from the harmful effects of freezing</span></span> (cite). While the
      scientists behind this research are unsure why there can be such a large difference in shelf lives, they are
      saying it is important to look further into <span class="tooltip">cryoprotectants<span class="tooltiptext">a
          helpful chemical used to protect organics from the harmful effects of freezing</span></span>, <span
        class="tooltip">buffers<span class="tooltiptext">a chemical that protects against extreme changes in acidity or
          basicity</span></span>, and storage temperatures to determine the exact reason (cite). For the sake of having
      a greener planet this type of research is absolutely necessary to continue and consider when moving forward with
      this type of treatment.
