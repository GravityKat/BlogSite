    <h2>Getting it Through Your Head: How Biomedical Engineers are Using Nanoparticles and Focused Ultrasound to Treat
      Brain Tumors</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      You probably have not heard of biomedical engineers, but you use their inventions every single day. From the
      tomato in your sandwich to your leggings or the annual flu shot, biomedical engineering is everywhere! The role of
      a biomedical engineer is to apply scientific discoveries and technology towards solving problems in health.
      <br><br>
      A major issue in health is cancer. Living creatures are made up of small subunits, called cells. Cancer is a
      disease where a person’s cells mutate and start dividing and growing uncontrollably. This can result in large
      growths of mutated cells, called a tumor. It is very likely you know of someone who has had cancer, it is
      estimated that around 2 in 5 Canadians will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime (). Cancer is also the
      leading cause of death in the world ().
      <br><br>
      A particularly difficult type of cancer to treat is tumors in the brain. Brain tumors are difficult to treat
      because… Biomedical engineers have been focusing on solving this problem, researching and developing ways to
      specifically target cancer cells without harming the brain. A new approach that might solve this problem is a
      combination of two technologies: nanoparticles and focused ultrasound.

    <h3>Focused What Now?</h3>
    <p>
      When you hear the word “ultrasound”, you might think of one of those cone-shaped black and white grainy pictures
      of you or a loved one as a baby, still growing inside the womb. This is an example of <span
        id="boldtext">ultrasound
        imaging</span>.

      On the other hand, <span class="tooltip">focused ultrasound<span class="tooltiptext">Focused ultrasound is a
          noninvasive therapeutic technology with the potential to transform the treatment of many
          medical disorders by using ultrasonic energy to target tissue deep in the body without incisions or
          radiation.</span></span> (commonly abbreviated as <span id="boldtext">FUS</span>) is a newer
      technology which can
      vibrate,
      heat up, and even destroy tissue in a targeted area. Have you ever held a magnifying glass outside on a sunny
      day? If you have, you’d notice the sun converges to one single point in the middle - it’s focused. The sun by
      itself may feel warm on your skin, but that focused point can actually set things on fire! This is roughly
      analogous to how focused ultrasound works, but this time, we are using very high
      frequency sound
      instead of
      light. These focused sound waves can pass through skin without harm, but come to a focused point inside the
      body. One common use case is to use focused ultrasound to damage a tumor in a controlled manner - this is
      typically referred to as <span class="tooltip">ablation<span class="tooltiptext">The removal or destruction of a
          body part or tissue or its function</span></span>.
