    <h2>Getting it Through Your Head: How Biomedical Engineers are Using Nanoparticles and Focused Ultrasound to Treat
      Brain Tumors</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <span class="tooltip">word<span class="tooltiptext">This is the definition of
        the
        word.</span></span>

    <p>
      You probably have not heard of <span class="tooltip">biomedical engineer<span
          class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>s, but you use their inventions every single day. From the tomato
      in your sandwich to your leggings or the annual flu shot, biomedical engineering is everywhere! The role of a
      biomedical engineer is to apply scientific discoveries and technology towards solving problems in health.

      A major issue in health is <span class="tooltip">cancer<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>. Living
      creatures are made up of small subunits, called <span class="tooltip">cells<span
          class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>. Cancer is a disease where a person’s cells mutate and start
      dividing and growing uncontrollably. This can result in large growths of mutated cells, called a <span
        class="tooltip">tumor<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>. It is very likely you know of someone
      who has had cancer – it is estimated that around 2 in 5 Canadians will be diagnosed with cancer during their
      lifetime. Cancer is also the leading cause of death in the world.

      A particularly difficult type of cancer to treat is tumors in the brain. Brain tumors are difficult to treat
      because: 1) it is difficult to detect brain tumors early on, 2) it is difficult to remove the tumors through
      surgery without damaging the brain, and 3) current cancer drugs cannot access the brain tumors due to the <span
        class="tooltip">blood-brain barrier<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>. The blood-brain barrier
      is a layer of very tightly spaced cells, which blocks the transport of certain molecules between the blood and the
      brain.

      <span class="tooltip">Biomedical engineer<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>s have been focusing on
      solving these two problems, researching and developing ways to 1) specifically target cancer cells without harming
      the brain and 2) allow cancer drugs to access tumors by bypassing the blood-brain barrier. A new approach that
      might solve these problems is a combination of two technologies: <span class="tooltip">focused ultrasound and
        nanoparticles<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>.

    <h3>Focused What Now?</h3>
    <p>
      When you hear the word “ultrasound”, you might think of one of those cone-shaped black and white grainy pictures
      of you or a loved one as a baby, still growing inside the womb. This is an example of <span
        class="tooltip">ultrasound imaging<span class="tooltiptext">definition</span></span>.

      On the other hand, <span class="tooltip">focused ultrasound<span class="tooltiptext">Ultrasound but stronger and
          concentrated, which can vibrate, heat up, and even destroy tissue</span></span> (commonly abbreviated as FUS)
      is a newer technology that can vibrate, heat up, and even destroy tissue in a targeted area. Have you ever held a
      magnifying glass outside on a sunny day? If you have, you’d notice the sun converges to one single point in the
      middle - it’s focused. The sun by itself may feel warm on your skin, but that focused point can actually set
      things on fire! This is roughly analogous to how <span class="tooltip">focused ultrasound<span
          class="tooltiptext">Ultrasound but stronger and concentrated, which can vibrate, heat up, and even destroy
          tissue</span></span> works, but this time, we are using very high frequency sound instead of light. These
      focused sound waves can pass through skin without harm, but come to a focused point inside the body. One common
      application is to use <span class="tooltip">focused ultrasound<span class="tooltiptext">Ultrasound but stronger
          and concentrated, which can vibrate, heat up, and even destroy tissue</span></span> to damage a tumor in a
      controlled manner - this is typically referred to as <span class="tooltip">ablation<span
          class="tooltiptext">Controlled destruction of a tumor in the body</span></span>.
